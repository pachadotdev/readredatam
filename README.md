# redatam

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This program converts Redatam files to CSV files and is a C++ 11 translation of:
1. The Redatam converter originally written in C# (https://github.com/discontinuos/redatam-converter).
2. The redatam4r package (https://github.com/FranciscoDA/redatam4r/)

Works with R 4.3.0+ on Linux/Mac/Windows but needs extra work.
